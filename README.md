I chose to implement filtering and sorting on the client side. 
This is because the amount of data is relatively small and can be easily handled by the customer. 
However, if the amount of data is large, 
it may be more efficient to implement server-side filtering and sorting to reduce the amount of data that must be transferred to the client.
